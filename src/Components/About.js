           Little Lemon was founded by two passionate chefs, Mario and Adrian, who dreamed of bringing the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean to the heart of Chicago. Inspired by their grandmotherâ€™s recipes and a love for fresh ingredients, Little Lemon blends tradition with a modern twist in every dish.
